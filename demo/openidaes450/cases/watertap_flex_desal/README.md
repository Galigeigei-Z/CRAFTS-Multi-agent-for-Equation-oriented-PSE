# WaterTAP FlexDesal

`watertap_flex_desal`

## Description and specification

Build the WaterTAP FlexDesal system with intake, pretreatment, reverse osmosis, post-treatment, brine discharge, onsite solar generation, battery storage, and grid-power balancing.

## Selected computation

- Model type: `original_reduced_model`
- Execution status: `fresh_completed`
- Solver result: `optimal` — [solver summary](solver_summary.json)

Original full-horizon model with fixed all-on schedule and nominal recovery; no free-binary scheduling optimum.

## Solver and property metadata

[Solver status and termination evidence](solver_summary.json) · [Property-package identity summary](property_summary.json)

This model does not define IDAES parameter packages; see the applicability record for its model-specific configuration.

## Results and configuration

The files below contain the selected computed outputs and execution evidence. Empty or unavailable fields are preserved. Models without process-stream ports or IDAES unit blocks do not provide conventional stream/unit tables. The solver report records convergence for the implemented model.

## Python solver and model programs

- [executable_source.py](executable_source.py)
- [model.py](model.py)
- [Shared runner and its source location](../../sources/workspace/release/openidaes450_executable/scripts_finish/flex_runner_v5.py)

`model.py` invokes the shared launcher; `executable_source.py` is the selected runner. Some runners import shared model-building modules. These dependencies are supplied under `sources/`; upstream packages, solver libraries and external data still need the documented environment.

## Reproduce and inspect

Follow the [reproduction and inspection guide](../../REPRODUCING_AND_INSPECTING.md), use this repository’s `demo/openidaes450` directory or the extracted release archive and activate the recorded compatible environment. From `demo/openidaes450` in the repository (or the extracted `OpenIDAES-450-demo` directory):

```bash
python run_case.py --case watertap_flex_desal --output /tmp/watertap_flex_desal-rerun
```

Use a new output directory. Some cases require external source/data bindings or specialized solver libraries; inspect the setup guide and selected source before running. Compare the new outputs with these selected results on matching bases and units, and retain any residual warnings.
