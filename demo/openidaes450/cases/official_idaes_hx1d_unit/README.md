# Hx1D Unit

`official_idaes_hx1d_unit`

## Description and specification

Model an IDAES one-dimensional heat exchanger with distributed hot- and cold-side behavior along the exchanger length.

[Full specification](specification.json) · [Topology](topology.json) · [Case metadata](case.json)

## Selected computation

- Model type: `native_IDAES`
- Execution status: `fresh_completed`
- Solver result: `optimal` — [solver summary](solver_summary.json)

Consult the original specification, executable source in the release archive, and solver evidence for the implemented scope.

## Solver and property metadata

[Solver status and termination evidence](solver_summary.json) · [Property-package identity summary](property_summary.json)

| Model component | Property/reaction package class |
|---|---|
| `fs.properties_shell` | `idaes.models.properties.iapws95.Iapws95ParameterBlock` |
| `fs.properties_tube` | `idaes.models.properties.modular_properties.base.generic_property.GenericParameterBlock` |

Configuration and thermodynamic options are recorded in [property_packages.json](property_packages.json).

## Results and configuration

The files below contain the selected computed outputs and execution evidence. Empty or unavailable fields are preserved. Models without process-stream ports or IDAES unit blocks do not provide conventional stream/unit tables. The solver report records convergence for the implemented model.

## Python solver and model programs

- [executable_source.py](executable_source.py)
- [model.py](model.py)
- [Shared runner and its source location](../../sources/workspace/stage3_specs_solve/run_hx1d_reference_solve.py)

`model.py` invokes the shared launcher; `executable_source.py` is the selected runner. Some runners import shared model-building modules. These dependencies are supplied under `sources/`; upstream packages, solver libraries and external data still need the documented environment.

## Reproduce and inspect

Follow the [reproduction and inspection guide](../../REPRODUCING_AND_INSPECTING.md), use this repository’s `demo/openidaes450` directory or the extracted release archive and activate the recorded compatible environment. From `demo/openidaes450` in the repository (or the extracted `OpenIDAES-450-demo` directory):

```bash
python run_case.py --case official_idaes_hx1d_unit --output /tmp/official_idaes_hx1d_unit-rerun
```

Use a new output directory. Some cases require external source/data bindings or specialized solver libraries; inspect the setup guide and selected source before running. Compare the new outputs with these selected results on matching bases and units, and retain any residual warnings.
